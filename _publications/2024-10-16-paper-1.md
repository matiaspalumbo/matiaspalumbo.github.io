excerpt: '*(Preprint)* In this paper, we study the dynamics of certain linear operators in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series and holomorphic functions, with a focus on multiplication and Toeplitz operators. As a recurrent method in the results that follow, we first prove a given property of a linear operator that acts on Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions, and then transfer the property to the realm of Dirichlet series by applying the Bohr transform, which is remarkably well-behaved for this purpose. We also generalize some well-known results to more general settings.'

Abstract: We study multiplicative Toeplitz operators on Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series $$\mathcal H_p$$. To this aim, we first study structural properties of $$\mathcal H_p^*$$ that are parallel to those of $$\mathcal H_p$$. Among other results, we prove a Cole-Gamelin type inequality and we find the abscissa of absolute convergence of $$\mathcal H_p^*$$. We also identify $$\mathcal H_p^*$$ with a space of co-analytic series on $$\mathbb{D}_2^\infty$$, the set of square-summable sequences in $$B_{c_0}$$. We apply these results to describe the dynamics of 
adjoint multiplication operators and multiplicative Toeplitz operators, and show among other results that they are hypercyclic  if and only if the image of the  symbol intersects the unit circle $$\mathbb{T}.$$
