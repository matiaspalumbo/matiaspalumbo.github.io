Abstract: In this paper, we study the dynamics of certain linear operators in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series and holomorphic functions, with a focus on multiplication and Toeplitz operators. As a recurrent method in the results that follow, we first prove a given property of a linear operator that acts on Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions, and then transfer the property to the realm of Dirichlet series by applying the Bohr transform, which is remarkably well-behaved for this purpose. We also generalize some well-known results to more general settings.
