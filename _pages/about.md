I'm a PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) and the [MRC Laboratory of Medical Sciences](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/). My project lies at the intersection of applied mathematics and developmental biology, and I'm co-supervised by Dr. Omer Karin (head of the [Karin Lab](https://karin-lab.github.io/website/), Imperial College London) and Dr. Vicki Metzis (head of the [Metzis Lab](https://metzislab.org/), MRC LMS).

My current research focuses on the mathematical modelling of biological systems, specifically gene regulatory networks involved in the cellular differentiation processes that happen during embryonic development. A key goal of my work is to integrate biomathematical approaches with the increasing amount of available bioinformatic data in order to understand the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie cell fate decisions during development.

When it comes to being outside of the office, I enjoy engaging in all kinds of sports, playing the guitar while mumbling lyrics, going to the cinema and checking out the local scene.

<!-- In July 2024, I graduated from the five-year integrated Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics, a Master's-equivalent program offered by the National University of Rosario. My degree thesis concerned the dynamics of linear operators in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series. -->

<!-- I am currently exploring PhD opportunities while continuing the research done for my thesis with Santiago Muro (National University of Rosario) and Rodrigo Cardeccia (Balseiro Institute) within a [CIFASIS-CONICET](https://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/en/) project. Our current work focuses on the dynamics of multiplicative Toeplitz operators and adjoint multiplication operators in Hardy spaces of both Dirichlet series and holomorphic functions in high dimensions. A large part of our work is done in the setting of dual Hardy spaces, which are not yet well understood, so we are also seeking useful characterizations of the elements of these spaces in terms of holomorphic functions and formal series. -->

<!-- The Mathematics degree I completed covers a wide variety of topics, including real and complex analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, functional analysis, algebraic structures, general topology, smooth manifolds, probability theory and graph theory. I have also completed college courses on Python and C programming, data structures and algorithms, machine learning and fractional differential equations. -->

<!-- I have pursued a number of extracurricular activities throughout my studies. Some examples are: -->
<!-- - I authored a monograph on transcendental number theory that obtained the first prize in the 2022 National Monograph Contest organized by the [Mathematical Union of Argentina](https://www.union-matematica.org.ar/). -->
<!-- - I developed a custom Python module within [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (a Python mathematical animation library) to render and visualize dynamical systems. -->
<!-- - I participated in the [10th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), a selective networking conference where young researchers can interact with laureates from awards like the Abel Prize and the Fields Medal. -->
<!-- - I organized and taught a LaTeX workshop aimed at both undergraduate and graduate Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics students. -->

<!-- I have a great deal of ambition, and being part of the world of Mathematics is something that fulfills me to a great extent. I am thrilled about the prospect of pursuing a PhD and making meaningful contributions to science. -->

<!-- Outside of the classroom, I enjoy taking part in all kinds of sports (volleyball in particular!), going to the cinema, playing the guitar and spending time with my friends and family. -->
