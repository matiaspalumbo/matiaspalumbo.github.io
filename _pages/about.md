I am a deeply inquisitive person with a sincere and profound passion for mathematics. In July 2024, I graduated from the five-year integrated Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics, a Master's-equivalent program offered by the National University of Rosario. My degree thesis concerned the dynamics of linear operators in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series.

I am currently exploring PhD opportunities while continuing the research done for my thesis with Santiago Muro (National University of Rosario) and Rodrigo Cardeccia (Balseiro Institute) within a [CIFASIS-CONICET](https://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar/en/) project. Our current work focuses on the dynamics of adjoint multiplication operators in spaces of both Dirichlet series and holomorphic functions in high dimensions.

The Mathematics degree I completed covers a wide variety of topics, including real and complex analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, functional analysis, algebraic structures, general topology, smooth manifolds, probability theory and graph theory. I have also completed college courses on Python and C programming, data structures and algorithms, machine learning and fractional differential equations.

I have pursued a number of extracurricular activities throughout my studies. Some examples are:
- I authored a monograph on transcendental number theory that obtained the first prize in the 2022 National Monograph Contest organized by the [Mathematical Union of Argentina](https://www.union-matematica.org.ar/).
- I developed a custom Python module within [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) (a Python mathematical animation library) to render and visualize dynamical systems.
- I participated in the [10th Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/), a selective networking conference where young researchers can interact with laureates from awards like the Abel Prize and the Fields Medal.
<!-- - I organized and taught a LaTeX workshop aimed at both undergraduate and graduate Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics students. -->

I have a great deal of ambition, and being part of the world of Mathematics is something that fulfills me to a great extent. I am thrilled about the prospect of pursuing a PhD and making meaningful contributions to science.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy taking part in all kinds of sports (volleyball in particular!), going to the cinema, playing the guitar and spending time with my friends and family.
