I am a deeply inquisitive person with a sincere and profound passion for mathematics. In July 2024, I graduated from the five-year Integrated Master's Degree in Mathematics offered by the National University of Rosario. My master's thesis concerned the dynamics of linear operators in Hardy spaces of Dirichlet series.

I am currently exploring PhD opportunities while continuing the research done for my thesis with Santiago Muro (National University of Rosario) and Rodrigo Cardeccia (Balseiro Institute) within a CIFASIS-CONICET project. Our current work focuses on the dynamics of adjoint multiplication operators in spaces of both Dirichlet series and holomorphic functions in high dimensions.

The Mathematics degree I completed covers a wide variety of topics, including real and complex analysis, linear algebra, differential equations, functional analysis, algebraic structures, general topology, smooth manifolds, probability theory and graph theory. I have also completed college courses on Python and C programming, data structures and algorithms, machine learning and fractional differential equations.

I have pursued a number of extracurricular activities throughout my studies. Some examples are:
- I authored a monograph on transcendental number theory that obtained the first prize in the 2022 National Monograph Contest organized by the Mathematical Union of Argentina.
- I developed a custom Python module within Manim (a Python mathematical animation library) to render and visualize dynamical systems.
- I participated in the 10th Heidelberg Laureate Forum, a selective networking conference where young researchers can interact with laureates from awards like the Abel Prize and the Fields Medal.
<!-- - I organized and taught a LaTeX workshop aimed at both undergraduate and graduate Mathematics, Computer Science and Physics students. -->

I have a great deal of ambition, and being part of the world of Mathematics is something that fulfills me to a great extent. I am thrilled about the prospect of pursuing a PhD and making meaningful contributions to science.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy taking part in all kinds of sports (volleyball in particular!), going to the cinema, playing the guitar and spending time with my friends and family.

<!-- This is the front page $$2^x$$ of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
